# Finding My Cause

*Choosing a main quest*

I grew up in a Rush Limbaugh home. I heard his voice most afternoons, echoing from some other room or the tinny car radio while driving from place to place. I could say a lot of things about Rush Limbaugh, but I'll keep it to the most relevant: Rush Limbaugh struggled with intellectual humility. I don't think that is even controversial. If you are a fan, it is probably part of his appeal. If you are not a fan, it is probably part of his... ChatGPT, what is the opposite of "appeal?"

Let's be fair to Rush. I think most of us struggle with intellectual humility, he just struggled with it the most. What was his phrase, "talent on loan from God"? Some of this was tongue in cheek, but he engaged with people and issues as if he believed it very strongly.

Why is intellectual humility so difficult for us? I'm not qualified to say. I have struggled too, a random sample of people who have a blog might be low in this virtue. It is not even universally recognized as a virtue. I recently heard one voice that championed it as a virtue, and that was Greg Lukianoff. He was a guest of podcaster Lex Friedman, and their conversation was uplifting and fascinating. Here is a snippet:

In America and probably everywhere, it is difficult to find a good balance of political opinionation (*click*, *add to dictionary*). It seems like we are either hot or cold, extremely opinionated or disengaged. There may be many among us who strike a healthy balance, but the very nature of their virtue makes them difficult to notice. In a Rush Limbaugh home, it was definitely a faux pas to not have a stance on any given issue that you were willing to defend to the death.

Certain issues are particularly difficult to avoid granting yourself an honorary doctorate. Perhaps you were also surprised to find out how many people were latent experts on infectious disease during the covid years.

I think that might be part of the problem: as individuals, we have too many causes. It is easy to see how we might find ourselves here. Every other commercial, social media post, news story, podcaster, presents an issue and issues a call to action. It could be something genuinely critical, that we care very much about. But maybe the sheer number of issues important to us can become overwhelming. Maybe it makes us bad at doing anything useful about any one of those issues. When we have a hundred hills we are willing to die on, it is no wonder that we feel beleaguered. This can start a vicious cycle, it nurtures a feeling of inefficacy which might make me even more compelled to take up the next cause that pulls at my heart. 

Speaking for myself, I am starting to see the appeal to having a single social cause. There could be one thing I can fight for, and for other issues I will nurture a feeling of comfort taking a back seat.  

Choosing an issue should come down to some combination of conviction and ability. There are many issues on which I find myself convected and with a low ability to do anything helpful. I care deeply about transportation and its impact on our planet. I will take the bus whenever possible. But I am bad at winning hearts and minds, people love their cars. It might be important to choose an issue I can do more than talk about. 

There is one issue that I feel both conviction and confidence I can make a difference. In Aurora and many cities, people are struggling to find shelter. As I write this, there are three tents in the grove of trees outside my home. I sometimes hear the sounds of their struggle at night. I understand how easy it is to fall through the cracks, and how hopeless it can feel when you are down there. I recognize that these are my neighbors. I recognize that we are all in this together. I have always sought a realistic and compassionate understanding of the ways people can struggle.

A commitment to a single cause doesn't have to be tunnel vision. I still care about other causes. But I believe it will be easier to be effective in any cause when I have just one that I feel compelled to speak up about. I believe this is the best way to manifest intellectual humility in my own life, to recognize my limitations on this particular dimension. When it comes to myself, I need to be ready to follow my conscience on a wide number of issues. But as it relates to someone else's conscience, maybe recognizing your limits is the essential challenge of intellectual humility.

What if we all adopted this approach? It might be easier to focus on the good things at holiday dinners. I will reach for balance and humility, even in my main cause. I have come to recognize balance, humility, and conviction as a good recipe for wisdom. Perhaps we should choose a cause on which we believe we hold a unique perspective. It is important, especially then, to reach for a deep expression of intellectual humility. Remember that the best ambassadors know how to share ground, looking to see eye to eye, not from a place of superiority.
