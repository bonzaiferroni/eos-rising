# The Fountain of Life

We are both the water and the sponge 
The water is curiosity 
The sponge is a need to be seen

A sponge becomes dry on its own
It shrinks and loses faith in the sponge spirit
It searches now for the cardboard spirit

Water becomes dry on its own
Before that, shapeless and spreading thin
It hopes to ruin a sock before it disappears

The water inside sees the sponge inside
It sees a perfectly good sponge
It rushes to fill a void

The water inside sees the sponge outside
The magic in water lets it divide
A part flows away, becomes more

We are the water
We are the sponge
We are the fountain of life
