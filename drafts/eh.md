I suppose navigating social relationships has become a little more challenging for me as I get older. I think this tree has many different roots.

I can be a tad hedonistic. I have an ego that I have to chase down and tackle sometimes. I sometimes judge my talents and skills more generously than other people. I guess you could sum it all up by saying that I can be a tad self-absorbed. It is a very human way to be, and yet I know so many people that prove that we don't have to be that way. 

I've always been interested in people and the life of the mind. It is why I chose psychology as a major. I had a very different educational experience, growing up. I had to learn many things on my own, both in school and in my personal life. This has given me a slightly uneasy relationship with other people. It's easy for me to make mistakes through simply not knowing what people usually do. I am also more sincere than people are sometimes expecting, because sincerity went out of style to some degree but not all of us like that. You could think of it as farmboy syndrome. 

I am always trying to smile and make eye contact and have little moments with people
