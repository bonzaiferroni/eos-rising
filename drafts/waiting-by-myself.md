It seems like I've been hoarding dignity long enough, time for another post about my dating life. Actually, I went on a nice date.

It has been quite sometime since I got a Hinge notification. I can't remember the last thing I added to my profile, it is possible I sabotaged it again. Or maybe the Hinge algorithm figured out that it is never going to wring a dime from me. I realize that Hinge isn't on my phone anymore, I must have gotten rid of it in a fit of good sense. Glad to be on the other side of that, I reinstall it. I edit my dating profile, I upload a couple new pictures now that I have a beard. I also mention my dating blog and give the address. That's guerrilla marketing, although I'm not sure what I am marketing. No problem, we'll figure it out.

The first connection I get is from someone who tells me they are also HNTDOC. I'm not sure of this abbreviation. I google it, no luck. I confess that I don't know, and it turns out she is referring to my blog, How Not to Date: On Colfax. It is the very first time I don't recognize an internet abbreviation and it is my own thing. 

Someone read my blog and they still want to talk. I'm not sure how to handle this positive turn of events and I go to bed. We talk for a few days and trade some songs, good stuff too. Then, one day, she's just not in my connections.

But it's cool because I started talking to someone else. Strangely enough, it is someone that I reached out to first. For some reason, these never connect. Maybe Hinge hates me. Maybe my type is better and finding me than I am and finding her. But this time was different. I sent her a comment about a picture in which she is proudly standing next to pumpkins, and she messaged me back.

It turns out, her animal spirit is the goat, but she isn't sure why. Hoping to be helpful, I ask her if she has a strong affinity for standing on top of things. She says that she does, but mostly figuratively and perhaps not literally.

It turns out, she is a PhD student and she goes to my old campus. We talk like nerds. I tell her about my days as a PhD student and how glad I was to survive it. She says she is confused, do I have a PhD after all? No, I survived it mostly literally, but perhaps not figuratively. But I tell her about what I do now and we have lots to talk about. 

We talk over several days. I tell her about an article I am trying to write. She tells me about a research poster she is making. She tells me the conference is in a couple days and there is a $250 prize for the best poster. That morning I remember to wish her luck and tell her that I think she is going to win. It turns out that she is a Fulbright scholar and she told me about the poster so it seems like a safe bet. She later messages me and tells me that she did, in fact, win.

We have been talking for a week, and I ask if she would like to meet over a cup of coffee. She tells me she is busy this weekend but we make plans for next weekend. 

On the morning we are going to meet, she asks me if I'm still up for it, and I am. She tells me that she is going to be across the street at a protest. She tells me Biden is going to be on campus. It turns out she meant Jill Biden, but I am very impressed. I ask her where the protest is. It wouldn't even be my first Hinge date where we met at a protest. But she says that she is just leaving and she will meet me at the coffee shop.

I wait inside the cozy cafe. It is spring and there are blossoms and buds on the trees but this morning it is snowing like crazy, big wet flakes that are coming down so beautifully. She comes through the door and we hug and say hellos. We order coffee and she teases me for ordering the same thing as her (busted).

She has an accent and I ask her where she is from. She is surprised that we hadn't talked about that, she tells me that it is usually a part of her screening that I must have missed. I feel bad for flying under the radar. But she is from somewhere in the middle east and she tells me all about it. We talk for quite some time, sitting in front of a big cozy fire. She had her feet up to the fire because her shoes were meant for the springtime weather we were not having and she was just standing outside, yelling at the first lady.

We talk about so much. We both hit the jackpot in having great nieces and nephews. We both have had some trouble navigating a relationship with a sibling. We talk about our relationships. She tells me about an amazing friend she has whose name also happens to be the name of the country where he is from. She tells me about her last relationship and the struggle she faces now that they decided to be friends. 

She tells me about the political causes that she is passionate about. She tells me about life as a PhD student, her feet still up toward the fireplace. She tells me about how frustrating to live here but also all the things she loves about living here.

We have talked for 3 hours and we both have other plans coming up soon. We hug and say goodbye. 

We exchange more messages. We talk about meeting again. But sometimes I won't hear from her for several days and she apologizes and says that she hasn't forgotten about me, life is just very busy. This goes on for a little while.  

I realize I never heard her name and it isn't one that I had heard before. I ask ChatGPT how it is pronounced and run the results by her. She is impressed because ChatGPT got it right. She apologizes for being so out of touch.

She won't be very available for the next couple of weeks. She will try to squeeze me in sometimes for another coffee. I'm starting to get the sense that we are looking for something different. We talk about it, and she understands. She thanks me for being direct, and I thank her for the experience of talking in front of that big cozy fire. We wish each other luck and say goodbye.
