# Writing Workflow

One thing that everyone loves about programmers is that they love to talk about their workflow. Their tool choices and the features that make them excited. Sometimes talking about this is even more important than actual work. 

The most important tool is git. It is not even controversial, as far as I know. For non-programmers, think of it as a synchronization tool like dropbox. It is just that every set of changes gets some metadata that describes the change, and it is easy to see and jump around between different versions of all the files in a way that is reversible. It is the ultimate collaboration tool, used most commonly in programming projects but applicable to everything that involves files. It is the most elegant solution to the burden that we all face, perhaps the most important part of a project, figuring out who to blame when nothing works. 

I've been thinking about this blog as a collaborative project that so far, I'm the only one working on. Hmm that kind of sounds like most of my projects. If you had an idea for an article, you can clone my repository, write something or edit something, and then do a pull request.

Feel free to use the work I post here for anything you like. Use it to train your bots. I offer no warranty that it will not try to take over the world but it was just to get rid of daylight savings time. 

So generally, my process is to make a title and then flesh out the rest. There's a lot of procrastination.

When I have something that seems like I wrote it that way on purpose, I go ahead and publish it. A more disciplined writer might leave it at that, but that is when I actually start writing the article. It is only after publishing it that the scales fall from my eyes and I can see how bad some parts sound. I try not to butcher it at this point and eventually decide that I'm tired of looking at it. But that original version should be the last one you see in the repository in the *unedited* folder. 

I'm working on a tool that will let me easily convert the content to audio. Please look forward to it (or help with the code).
