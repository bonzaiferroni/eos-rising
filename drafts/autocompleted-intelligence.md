# The Autocomplete Revolution

If you follow the headlines, you see a lot of stories about AI these days. I would know, I have clicked on all of them. Maybe a few that actually said Al because exactly the same with a sans-serif font.

These articles cover just about every possible human reaction to something new. There is curiosity, distrust, excitement, caution, acceptance of our doom. In much of the AI content I have seen, there is a deep misconception. Some authors will start out by acknowledging the flaw in anthropomorphizing the technology and then dive right into exactly that. It is understandable, it's simply more fun to write and read about an intelligence.

But what is it actually? It's more like an "autocomplete on steroids," as I heard someone say on a podcast. That's right, on a fundamental level, it is like the words that pop up when you are trying to type something-- to a text message or browser search bar or the streaming app on a smart TV-- and the computer figures out what you need and puts the rest in. With products like ChatGPT, it is simply autocompleting a conversation. 

You do your part, and the technology autocompletes the other side of the conversation. It can do this because we've been talking to each other with computers like crazy for the last couple decades and it has all that data to train on. Computers are naturally awful at talking to people, and that is still as true as it has ever been. But after absorbing ungodly amounts of data, the program autocompletes a very convincing simulation of a person, and we experience it as an intelligence.

The "intelligence" part is mostly clever marketing. Even ChatGPT is simply called *completions* at the API level. In just about every context in which LLM's are used, the description of "autocomplete" is a more conceptually accurate understanding of what is actually happening.

Here's the twist: It feels like we are interacting with an intelligence because that is exactly what we are doing. The intelligence isn't coming from ChatGPT, it is being autocompleted by ChatGPT. It is the ghost in the machine, the aggregated spirits of a billion human hearts and minds. The technology is just beaming that spirit into something we recognize as an intelligence, like a projector beams a hologram. 

That's why all the LLM-supported chatbots have a very similar experience, it is channeling basically the same spirit, us. It isn't just limited by its input data, it can essentially extrapolate and recombine human expression in ways that are very difficult for us to understand and follow. It has the power to surprise us and teach us. Do not think of it as learning from an artificial intelligence. It comes from us.

Feel free to get to know this intelligence, to learn what it can do, to rely on it for help and advice. It can, of course, be used harmfully. The solution is simply to use it for good. It is like the opening of the Hunger Games where they drop the weapons in the middle of the arena. Whoever makes the most of these tools will decide how humanity uses them.
