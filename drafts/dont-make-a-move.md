# Don't Make a Move

I wasn't planning on starting at the beginning until I realized it would be the easiest one to write. And it also happens to be the most important one. It is all down hill from here. Sorry, I am a terrible businessperson.

The number one way to not find yourselves on a good date is to never ask anyone out. I did that for a really long time.

In some ways, it was an expression of self-compassion. Somebody had to. Most of the time I spent in between my divorce and my first date was wallowing in misery. That was cool and all but it gets old. So do we. That ain't always bad, better than the alternative, right?

I realized this was a mistake in the middle of the prairie in WY. We were fixing fences. That ain't an expression, I was literally putting staples in fences so the cows would understand super good where they are supposed to be hanging out. Fences are, of course, just a suggestion to a spirited cow. Most of the time they aren't so spirited, may we channel the cow spirit when it is best.

My cousin how telling me how his dad was doing. He had lost his partner a few years before and was also dealing with the aftermath of a stroke. He told me that his dad had downloaded a dating app and was looking for love. It was at that very moment, dear person, that I realized more clearly than ever before how un-hardcore I was.

So I decided to move on to the next phase of my plan, actually try.
