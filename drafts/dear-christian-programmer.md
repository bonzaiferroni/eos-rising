# Dear Christian Programmer

The last couple years, I've been going to church. It is a good place to see my family, they are all believers. I got curious about church again and even visited some other churches. I went to a wonderful church as a boy but it is no longer where I left it. I think I've been looking for it.

I don't have any beliefs anymore about God. I wouldn't say I lost them, I know where they are. I'm just thinking about other beliefs. 

I wouldn't say I've disowned them, either. They just don't seem to fit where I was trying to put them. I'm looking through the lego box of beliefs to see if there's a better one.

Sometimes I feel like I've found better-fitting beliefs, they are almost the same shape. They aren't quite god beliefs, they are if-god beliefs. If is a powerful word in programming, every language I've used seems to have it. I've refactored my belief functions to have a clause like this:

```
if (god.exists) {
	// everything I used to believe
} else {
	// something else
}
```

You might find this solution wanting elegance. I sympathize, I arrived here the same way I arrive at most programming solutions-- I needed a quick fix. I can use most of the same code but it better reflects my level of certainty.

Thankfully, most belief functions don't need this clause. It is surprising how often the correct solution is the same regardless of how `god.exists` evaluates. That might be the most important insight I've reached since I strayed. 

I suppose the biggest reason for this refactoring was the Christians in my life.
