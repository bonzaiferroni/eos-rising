# Gone Are All The Flowers

Sometimes in movies, a character starts sliding toward a steep dropoff and they desperately grab for something to hold on to. Life feels that way, recently. 

All the articles and podcasts make me believe my biggest issue is isolation. We are social creatures, like prairie dogs. We depend on others around us to feel a sense of safety. If you've ever walked through a prairie dog town, you probably heard their cute barks and maybe saw the tail signals. It is a warning to their family and neighbors. A lonely prairie dog might not have enough time to scurry to safety when a fox or a hawk is sighted. 

I'm not alone, at least from a statistical perspective. U.S. Surgeon General released an advisory on May 3rd of this year. It starts out like this:

> Today, United States Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy released a new Surgeon General Advisory calling attention to the public health crisis  of loneliness, isolation, and lack of connection in our country.

Dr. Murthy is barking a warning too. What do we do though? The instinct to scurry for home seems like part of the problem.

One of my favorite games of all time is called Don't Starve. The title is also the general goal of the game. Unless you really know what you are doing, and even then, most playthroughs have a sad ending. The idea is to last as long as you can. To survive, you maintain your health, energy, and sanity. You can actually survive without sanity, it's just much harder.

Some games are like a masterful work of art, and Don't Starve is on my personal list. The descent into madness is particularly evocative as a game experience. You start out among flowers and butterflies, bright colors around you and a world to explore. As misfortunes occur, and they always occur, you lose points on your sanity level. To restore points, you can eat particularly yummy food, wear fancy hats, or sleep in a warm bed. If none of those resources are available, you can always pick flowers, at least while they are growing. 

As winter rolls around, sanity becomes harder to restore. Gone are all the flowers. As your sanity creeps lower, you start to see shadows and hear whispers. The music begins to sound out of tune and the colors fade. You hear barking in the distance. Eventually the shadows start to attack you. The music becomes more desperate, the colors fade completely away, and the edges of your vision become dark and blurry. You must fight the ghostly manifestations of your own fears to stay alive. 

Whoever designed this game has known struggle.

There is a saying, "the only thing we have to fear is fear itself." It is true that fear can add an edge to an already complicated situation, it can push me down a slope so that I find myself grasping for something to hold on to. Fear adds a dark and pulsing overlay to the world. The problem is that I do not recognize it as an overlay, I recognize it as reality. At some point, the shadows become real to me. 

People recognize fear when they see it. The most common instinct is to stay away. Fear has a double edge, it changes the way we see other people and it changes the way people see us and react. As the song goes: *people are strange, when you're a stranger*. 

I have had a very unusual path through life. There is a part of me that wants to react to the shadows with kindness, to try and understand. As I ride the bus and walk the sidewalks of Denver, I meet people who are struggling. I know something about struggle and isolation. I try to have a smile and a helping hand ready.
