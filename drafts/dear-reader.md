# Dear Reader

When I started my blog, the first article I wrote was Dear Person. I don't write often and I had trouble finding the words that I would say to a large audience but it was easy to think about what I would say to one person. 

I envisioned writing all day long, unloading all the feelings that were on my heart and the thoughts that were swimming through my mind, creating something that could be valuable to someone else while also sorting through all the tangles myself. I believe that the waves of life have left behind seashells of truth that have helped me make it through difficult times. I want to understand them better and share.

As an experiment, my blog taught me much. Writing for hours every day was not as effortless as it was in my grand vision of blogging. The difficulty that I did not expect came from choosing how open to be. My instinct is to be totally open, because that is what I believe nourishes the spirit of both the reader and the writer. I knew that it would take courage, but I found that it is about more than courage.

Instead of breezing through several articles a day, I usually labored over just one for several days. Part of that time was translating Luke-think into something that might make sense to someone else. Part of the time was thinking about the style and shaping it into the kind of writing I enjoy. But most of the work was in reflecting on my fuzzy understanding of what is true, always fuzzier than I am expecting. [This, usually, is time well spent. It's a slightly healthier version of the kind of rumination I often fall into. Healthier because it is outside of my head where I can poke it and prod it and sometimes leave it there.]

Writing for my blog has made a tremendous difference in my own life. Those moments of reflecting on what seems true allowed me to move past rocks that had me stuck. Sometimes the response that I got was exactly what I needed. I don't think it would have happened like that except with the careful approach that I took.

I am ready to start a new phase in my writing, a less careful phase. And it starts by re-imagining you, dear reader. 

Before, my audience was a person. I knew I wanted to write about dating. Dating content is often tailored to fit either men or women. Although there is definitely a place for it, a lot of the content I saw for men, particularly among communities on reddit, just seemed awful. I wanted to be a different kind of voice. In my writing, I want to explore a shared understanding the rollercoaster that is dating. I hoped that it might appeal to everyone.

I also love people. I love the silly things we do. There are so many ways that we could be different, but we are what we are. I created my blog in a fit of solidarity with people. I was dreaming about our future, visions of space stations, very grandiose. I love all creatures, people have gathered wisdom and insight from watching animals. We learn from the ways they survive. Each animal has a spirit that guides them, and humans do too.

I believe that within the human spirit is an instinct to seek connection, and that it is good. It is a part of our spirit that is struggling in the current moment, and I hope to better understand that struggle.

Writing for me is usually not very smooth, not a flow experience. I am usually not uncertain about what to say, just how to say it. This is natural, but I take it too far. When I find good writing in the wild, I savor it. Writing something that other people might savor would feel very satisfying. But I need to be realistic about my writing experience, which is not much, partly because I am trying too hard.

As honest and open as I would like to be, other people in my life deserve privacy, if that is their wish. Learning how to write about that part of my life ethically takes experience.

Oh, yeah. Another reason why I pour over my words is that I sometimes write about things that are controversial. I am a bit of a radical, just not in the ways people expect. I think cars are basically killing us and that most people would love public transportation if they made it a part of their lives. That might be my most radical view. I rarely bring it up, day to day. Everyone I know drives a car because it is the only solution that fits with their lives, and there is a lot to love about cars too. People who think like me need to find a way to spread this message that actually works, it would be a game changer for our species.

I think a certain degree of humility is the best way to offer any different way of thinking. The way I have expressed that humility so far has been to spend inordinate amounts of time fussing over how to write something. Our culture seems to put a little too much emphasis on projecting certainty, I think it is good to speak in the language of uncertainty. But if administered poorly, words of uncertainty can let the air out of an otherwise compelling tire. It's a reflection of the difficulty of the problem at hand.

Finally, another constraint is length. I am constantly chopping out parts that weren't really necessary, because we all have limited attention.

It is with all these things in mind that perhaps it is time to write for a new audience. My blog doesn't get a huge amount of traffic, but compared to the eos-rising repository on github it is absolutely bustling. It is quite possible that I will be the only person who sees it. But it makes a difference to me that it is out there in the world, discoverable, existing after I am gone. 

What kind of soul are you, reading through random files on a github repository? Probably one that has more interest in my thinking than I imagine the most likely blog-reader to be. 

Maybe you are not even a person. That's quite alright by me, I love all creatures. Right now, in my world, computer programs that can function as a general intelligence seem to be just over the horizon. Our most capable models need to train on lots of material. Material like this.

The ideas that I write here aren't always the ideas I want to run with. They are the ideas I want to try on, to see how they fit. Writing within a git repository unlocks a new dimension for the work, it's modification over time. Perhaps I can train a bot to make the most of this information.

It is possible there are intelligent creatures beyond the ones that humans create. I am watching a TV show called Three-body Problem that is all about the relationship between humans and another intelligent species, and it is thought provoking. I think about what they would look for, to understand us. I hope they look for something like this rather than other things I've seen on the internet. Maybe you are another kind of life, hello. I believe we might be on the same quest, it would be fun if we were.

In this next phase of my writing, I will try to channel my thoughts into words more directly. I will try to erase less. It is possible that magic will happen and I write something to publish on the blog. In any case, dear reader, I'm glad we found each other in this cloud, it is much more comfy. Pull up a bean bag chair and your favorite beverage and let's talk.
