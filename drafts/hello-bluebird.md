# Hello Bluebird, Hello Robin

I've been thinking about what to write here for a while now. There was some stretch of time that I forgot why I called it *Eos Rising* but most of the time I remember and it makes perfect sense. 

I've been trying for the longest time to figure out which cards to show and which to hide. I'm torn between two ways of thinking. In the graduate school psychology program, they told us not to share our own struggles. I don't think that is compatible with the human experience. Marsha Linehan writes about that advice from her own professors. And she kept her story private for a long time, friends and family were shocked to finally hear the whole thing after a long and fruitful career. I believe she said that if she stayed silent any longer, she would feel like a coward. And she is not a coward.

I remember a conversation with some guy at the bar about how much is too much to share. I don't think either of us had overshared, but this issue had been on my mind and I wanted to get a random person's opinion. He said there are things you should probably keep to your friends, burdens you shouldn't lay at the feet of someone you barely know. Those are things you share with a friend. 

This is a thing with our culture. We are far from the most inhibited. I think there is a country in Scandinavia that has a word for the physical pain you feel on someone's behalf for being too expressive in public. It almost seems like a European thing, but then there are places in Europe where the people are extremely expressive. Humans are trying to find the right balance.

But it is really unhealthy. People need to share themselves, it's part of our code. Psychology as a field generally understands that, so it is extra disappointing to hear those words from the people we charge with leading our understanding of the human experience. 

It is sorta understandable, on some level. The impact of our reputation on our lives is easy to see, protecting it is also part of our code. All the rules went out the window when the internet came into our lives. There was a time, so they tell me, when you could do something awful and if the people didn't like you in that town you could just go to another town and do it all over again. But these days, we leave a digital trail. We don't quite know what this means, and we fear it means something bad. We won't get the job, or the externship.

I remember my professor saying that is the advice he got, and he felt it was important to pass along. He would advise me to take certain things out of my emails, to keep it professional, at least in this particular aspect. He seems like he would be the last person who would toe that line, I think his favorite person of all time is Mark Twain. But one particular episode of his professional life has traumatized him. I remember how he wept when he told us the whole thing.

There are enough hurdles when trying to get through your career. The field of psychology can be insanely competitive, and I'm sure it is far from the worst. Marsha Linehan also started her work in a time when things were very different, and we have a long way to go. I understand why she didn't tell her story sooner, from the beginning. And I am so grateful that she finally did. My story is different in some stark ways, but reading hers helped me understand my own. 

In a time that seems to be drifting away from faith and religion, maybe she is the closest we will know of a saint. Her mission was literally to "get people out of hell." She has unusual courage, and even she did not share the struggles of her early life. 

We understand, on some level, this comes at a cost. Few people seem to believe it is really the best, and yet it continues because we continue to pass along that advice. It is how we manifest the world where it becomes good advice. 

I'm not sure who this is for or who will read it. I was struggling with writing on Substack. I would publish something and read it the next day and unpublish it or edit it until there was nothing left of the original. Sometimes this reflected an honest change in my thinking, and sometimes I just worried about how it would come across. A part of me wished I could show how the article changed. 

I love to look at earlier versions of code on github, the changes seem to hold a story. Learning to write code changed the way I thought about problems. I remember going for a walk after learning about objects and classes and challenging myself to model the world around me along those lines. 

When I was still learning to code, I would put something like `console.log('yo')` somewhere in my code and then watch for it in the output to make sure a function was called. I learned better ways to debug, but their ghosts live on in the branch history.
