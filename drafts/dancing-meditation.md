Dancing is an emotional expression. Emotions aren't just processed in the head, they are processed all over the body. Let me tell you about my experience of dancing. 

As you begin to move, let the initial movement be like a body scan to identify points of tension. Movement is easiest when we are also breathing. As obvious as that seems, I forget sometimes. So first I find a nice, steady, slow breath, exactly as deep as feels comfy. It feels comfy when you reach the top or the bottom of a breath, the way a good stretch feels comfy. Each breath finds a slightly deeper stretch, until it fits exactly with what your body and mind need in the moment.

Start by swaying and notice where the center of gravity goes within your body. Imagine the center of gravity is a ball that begins to move freely along a smooth and steady path that you decide, no longer tethered to your center. Notice how it feels as it moves through each part of your body, bouncing softly here and there. Does it flow through some areas with more difficulty? You've found a point of stiffness.

^ That's the funny thing about tension and stiffness: sometimes leaning into it lets you regain control and then release it, if that is what you wish.

Sometimes the wish to relax is not enough, the stiffness has a hold. Let your mind play with it like a puzzle as you sway around it. Maybe there is another point of stiffness, and you finally find the one you need to let go first and the rest fades away in a cascade of wellness. Sometimes it appears somewhere else and it is a little like hide and seek. 

Now your muscles are warmed up and you are starting to have a little fun.
