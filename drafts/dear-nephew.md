# For Your Consideration

I'm sorry I wasn't there on your big night. I wanted to be, but I was carrying a heavy load, heavy enough to make me miss out on a lot of things that were important to me.

I heard it was great, I hope there is video. I feel like I could use some advice too.

Your pa asked me to prepare something anyway, and I'm honestly grateful for the chance. There's a lot I'd like to say to you, although I wouldn't call it advice. I'd call it *For Your Consideration*, because I'm still learning.

And you already know what you are doing, it seems like. I feel like asking you for advice. I'll tell you why.

You are kind. You help your sisters. They love you. It is great to have sisters, they love you and that's how you know you are a cool guy.

And you are cool. Don't believe that thing people say sometimes, that you shouldn't worry about being cool. Cool is just a way of being like the kind of person you admire. We shouldn't admire ourselves all the time, but sometimes. 

You are funny. I know you know this because you tell me the stories. Sounds like it isn't hard for you to find a good audience.

You are a good listener. I know this first hand because I got to teach you. We had a great time in our computer class. I hope you remember the section about Documents. There will be a test later.

But you will ace it because you already have a lot of experience with writing. And all writers need to know how to structure a document. It's however you want. I love your writing. It is like The Hardy Boys meets Rick and Morty. 

Now I have some things to apologize about. I'm sorry I tried to corrupt you. I should have known that was impossible, you are too good. I mean, not too good, just the right amount of good. I admire your conscientiousness. You are somehow a very good rule follower and a very good rebel. How do you do that?

My one advice here, in the interest of corrupting you, is to not follow the rules *too* much. Sorry if that is clich√©. There's no virtue in following a rule that you can see doesn't make sense. Make a judgment call, balancing all the things that are important to you. You can't use this advice to do whatever you want. Or you could. If you are a humble person, if you want good things, it is good.

I like that you are somehow both confident and meek. That's a hard balance to strike, reserved for only the most honest of souls. You are among the most honest souls I know. Never lose that. That's my advice to you. 

I like that you are an elf. You know the secret of the elves, that you can be an elf just by wishing it, and by having pointy ears at the same time. Helps if you can shoot a bow. I bet you are already doing that.

You are real. Sometimes this will make people uncomfortable. That's not your fault. It's not bad to think about whether people are comfortable, that is basically what a gentleman does. Being real is another way of saying that you don't do what people expect. This will sometimes catch them off guard, it makes them pay attention to the real world for a moment. Which might catch you off guard, because you aren't sure why that would catch them off guard, which starts a spiral of off guarding. Sometimes this is really fun. Sometimes it gets serious for a moment. You'll know what to do.

I heard you like dancing. So I put dancing in your dancing, and now you are dancing. Because of course you like dancing, it is great and I bet you are good at it. Keep dancing. Always stay dancing.

Do most things in the name of friendship.

That time you took out all the turrets in that big room in Portal 1 like some kind of portal ninja still goes down as one of my all time favorite video game moments. I'll never forget the way you release the button in Legend of Zelda when you are firing the bow, like you are firing an actual bow. Still alive.
