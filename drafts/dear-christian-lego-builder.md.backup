# Dear Christian Lego Builder

The last couple years, I've been going to church. It is where I can see my family, they are all believers. I even visited some other churches. As a boy, I went to church Franktown but it is no longer where I left it. 

I don't have any beliefs anymore about God. I wouldn't say I lost them, I know where they are. I'm just thinking about other beliefs. 

I wouldn't say I've disowned them, either. They just don't seem to fit where I was trying to put them. I'm looking through the lego box of beliefs to see if there's a better one.

Long hours of my childhood were spent rummaging through a large bin of lego pieces. I can close my eyes and hear the sound and feel the pieces slip between my fingers as my eyes scan the box for the piece I need. My brother works a few feet away and we regularly confer in our efforts. The radio is tuned to 106.7 if my parents are gone or 107.5 if they are home.

In the box are pieces from a hundred different lego sets. At one point they stood in all their glory, and at another point they were cannibalized to become something else. To honor their spirit, every so often they are rebuilt. Pirate coves and race tracks and space ships and knights and castles. The set I think about the most was a forest hideout that had a rope bridge between two trees and a spooky ghost.

But haven't you ever wanted to build something that wasn't on the box? I don't have beliefs about God, but I have some very similar pieces. I call them if-God beliefs. 

I'll give you an example:
If God created people, then they created a creature that created legos. A creature that loves curiosity and truth. A creature that can take any one of an infinite number of paths and still end up at the truth. If God is the original lego spirit, they did not create us to only make what is on the box. 

If God created the universe, they wrote all truth in creation, first, before it went into a book. If God speaks to us, it is through a whisper that we can never be sure is coming from our own heart or maybe deeper. That God would not care so much if we were all saying the exact same thing. They created us to care for and rejoice in creation, to echo divine love.

If Heaven is real, and if it is a heaven I want to find, it is full of people who didn't know .

I know the Bible says it has all the pieces we need. Let's set that aside for a moment. Didn't you ever want to build something that wasn't the thing on the box?
