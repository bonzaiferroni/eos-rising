# Live Far Away From People

The number one most effective way to not have a nice date on Colfax is to never be around people. I am the king of this, I was doing it before it was cool, I'm like a hipster hermit.

Without a doubt, this time period of my life was the most effective demonstration of never being on a good date by sheer virtue of never being on a date at all. As humans, we can be expert discomfort avoiders. As enriching as that kind of life can be, sometimes it does help to go through some moments of discomfort because we clearly see beautiful moments on the other side.

I recommend working from home and using grocery delivery services so that you can avoid the torment of being in the same space as others. Thank goodness for all the new technologies that make this dream possible.

Unfortunately, I started developing terrible habits, like going for a walk when I get stuck on something with work. During these walks, I'd exchange smiles and waves with neighbors and their cute pets. Oh, the humanity.

I suppose it might help to think about why someone would seek isolation. Maybe they've been hurt. Maybe that's the human version of a limp.

There's a beautiful little story that I'll probably have to mention frequently. It is called (get ready) *[The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse](https://www.amazon.com/Boy-Mole-Fox-Horse/dp/0062976583)*. They also made an [animated version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbdem4g_LEc).

In that story, there is a fox that follows the boy and the mole. They meet when the boy and the mole come across the fox, stuck in a trap. The mole approaches  even as the fox growls. The fox growls because it is scared, but it has the wisdom to receive help. Perhaps this kind of moment echoes in your own life. Perhaps you'll recognize it the next time it passes.

So, right, Living Far Away From People is a complete solution to the problem at hand. If you find it distasteful, worry not, there are other complete solutions to the pesky problem of being on a really good date. Please look forward to my next article, Never Make A Move.
