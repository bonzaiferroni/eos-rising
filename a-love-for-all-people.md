A Love For All People

I was raised in a Christian home. Although my beliefs have changed, there is at least one part that I have held. Christians are called to love all of humankind and to follow that love as a guide in living their lives.

There is a great power in that idea and it can be a blessing to your life even if you believe nothing else.

Humans learn best if we have an example to follow, and the example given to Christians is the love and life of Jesus. As a thought experiment, try to think of a greater love than laying down your life for someone else.

A lot of people talk about the power of love, but we don't always get examples or explanations. I will do my best, as I understand it.

They say if you ever go to prison and you don't want people to mess with you, fight the biggest bully. I don't know how true that is, but we can take a part of that idea and use it here. If you want to test the limit of your love, think of the person it would be hardest for you to love. 

If the scope of the question is all people, and that seems to be the scope in my title, the person that jumps to mind is the leader of Russia, Vladimir Putin. A part of me recoils at the idea of love for Putin. Such mental gymnastics, what is the point?

It helps to think about why it is hard to love Putin. He might be the biggest bully of our species. He is a murderer, he values power more than human life and dignity. He kills children, he destroys the dreams of families. He is petty and ridiculous, and has inspired a great many people to celebrate the appearance of strength at the cost of human life and dignity. He leads an entire nation in his cruelty, and they support him either because they are afraid of the alternative or they simply prefer cruelty to the appearance of weakness.

What good can come from trying to love Putin? There is a part of me, a part of all of us, that is capable of darkness and cruelty. It is the part that lives in fear, locked away, scared and confused and hurting. It is just a part, and most of us find a way to let other parts decide what we do. But if we allow ourselves to try, we can think of a time when we acted from that part. When we wished to appear strong so we 

If love were an olympic sport, the ability to love Putin might win you the gold medal, but it is hard to see how it can make a practical difference. Maybe we should put aside the question of who is the hardest person in the world to love, and think about what is the hardest part of ourselves to love.

When the part of me that holds fear sees fear in another, I am more afraid. When the part of me that holds compassion sees fear in another, I am more compassionate. To love is to choose compassion over fear. 

The power of love is the power to see the beauty and goodness around you and inside you. It is the antidote to fear, it is the antidote to depression.
