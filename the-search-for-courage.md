# The Search for Courage

It has been a rollercoaster year. After a long time of working from home and spending too much time alone, I decided I would explore life a little more earnestly. 

I started a garden and grew some corn and squash and a couple tomatoes. I took singing lessons. I started a singing group with other students from the class. I went on some dates. I went dancing. I gave a driving lesson to a friend had her driving test the next day (she passed!). I got my first pair of cowboy boots. I hiked several fourteeners. I met some longtime friends for the first time. I met someone special. I took a road trip across the country with my aunt, the scenic route. I took up photography and started playing the guitar again.

It is interesting partly because this comes after several years of living like a hermit. I suppose "as a hermit" is more honest. A long time ago, I dropped out of grad school and I've worked as a freelance web developer in the meantime. Those years were as quiet as the last year has been loud.
