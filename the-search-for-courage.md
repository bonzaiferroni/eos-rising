# The Search for Courage

It has been a rollercoaster year. After a long time of working from home and spending too much time alone, I decided I would explore life a little more earnestly. 

I started a garden and grew some corn and squash and a couple tomatoes. I took singing lessons. I started a singing group with other students from the class. I went on some dates. I went dancing. I gave a driving lesson to a friend had her driving test the next day (she passed!). I got my first pair of cowboy boots. I hiked several fourteeners. I met some longtime friends for the first time. I met someone special. I took a road trip across the country with my aunt, the scenic route. I took up photography and started playing the guitar again.

It is interesting partly because this comes after several years of living like a hermit. I suppose "as a hermit" is more honest. A long time ago, I dropped out of grad school and I've worked as a freelance web developer in the meantime. Those years were as quiet as the last year has been loud.

Getting out there again, I learned a lot about myself. I always thought of myself as someone with the right amount of courage. I have not tried to be fearless, but I have tried to have the right amount of fear. I have tried to be brave without bravado. I know that at times in my life I have seemed fearless, and at times like I was hiding.

I have also faced more than anyone in my life understands. I have faced it alone. I just haven't known how to talk about it, not even to the person I married. I grew up in a lot of darkness.

As the Autumn days get shorter, I turn into a pumpkin earlier and earlier. I struggle to stay awake past 7pm. Work is very strange right now, and not just for me. ChatGPT is changing the way everyone works. It is sometimes spooky how clever it can seem. I don't have the same fears about AI that most of the people around me express. It doesn't understand what it is saying, it chooses each word based on statistics, not an understanding of the problem. But it is powerful and I have fears of my own about LLMs, not about what it will do but how people will decide to use it.

Before I was a programmer, I worked in mental health. I sat across from people facing their own struggles and I saw their courage. I have seen the strength of the human spirit, I have seen it move mountains. And I know that we can't always be strong.

Jim Grigsby was my faculty mentor in the program. He once told me that he thought I had something like hypomania. Not because I was doing anything wrong, but to understand the ways that I am different and the energy that I have. He told me about his own struggles. Jim thinks about the brain differently than most people in the field. I know this was not his intent, but it is unfortunate that most of the language we have in mental health uses the framework of pathology. 

One way that I am different is that I am unusually dedicated to my work. If something seems worth doing, I can pour all my energy into it for days or weeks or months or years. I do not need other people to see the value in it, although I am always grateful when they do. I don't think there is anything different about my brain that makes me capable of this dedication. I think that anyone who follows their curiosity will be blessed with the same energy and focus. I protect it and nurture it like an endangered species. I can't imagine doing anything different, nor do I plan to change. But these days I am more aware of the costs of that decision.

Another mentor in my life is Jeff "Gunny" Norman, former marine and current black belt and rock star. If anyone is qualified to talk about courage and fear, it is Gunny. He once told me that fear pulls you in. Fear becomes a problem when we fixate on it until it is all that we can see, like falling into a hole. It makes us doubt our strength and wonder if it was ever there to begin with.

My hands shake, they always have. Doctors have told me that I might have Essential Tremor, something very common but not well understood. I'm not sure I do. They seem to shake when I am doing something that I care strongly about. If I am intentional, they can be as steady as I wish, but it takes all my focus. I would rather focus on what I care about.   

People tend to see someone who shakes like I do as someone who is holding a lot of fear. That might be true, but I am holding more than fear. I hold whatever it takes to keep going.

It is strange, my hands shake the most when I am doing things that other people would find trivial, like pouring or carrying a full glass. I realize that behind the shaking is the fear of making a mistake, spilling. Growing up, mistakes that you would expect a child to make were met with disgust and sometimes explosive rage. Fear is something we learn and unlearning is not straightforward. 

I haven't gone out to play the guitar in quite some time. I notice that people look away from me now when I sing. Not everyone, I still get a lot of kindness. But sometimes I record it and I see what they see. I see someone with a lot of uncertainty, and it doesn't sound right. This is strange to me, because my first-hand experience of those moments was so different. I felt much more steady than I looked.

I'm not sure now why I thought I was ready to play music out on the street. When I sang with my partner, we sounded so beautiful to me. On my own, I can't hear it anymore, maybe it wasn't my own voice I was hearing. A few times in my life, it sounded like someone was singing along with me even when I was alone, I had to look around just to be sure no one was there. Maybe sometimes that voice is all I hear, even when other people just hear me.

Try not to look away from people who are struggling. We look away because the part of us that holds empathy does not want to hold that discomfort or pain. We live in a culture that encourages us to suffocate strong feelings, to hold it under water until it stops moving. Art and music is a healthy way to let it breathe. We understand that, and we allow it for people who have a lot of talent. Maybe we could also learn to encourage people who are just starting out. 

Empathy can be understood as an emotional simulation that happens automatically in the brain. It is a replay of what someone else seems to be experiencing with us in their shoes. This is why we look away, to abort the experiment. Yet in our own lives, we dream about self-expression. Look at all the movies about breaking out of that shell. Those movies tap into a huge undercurrent of experience in our culture. It is discouraging that our impulse isn't to be more supportive. But we have those inner critics, I believe that is what makes us look away. In the simulation we can hear them, and it sounds like they are talking to us. It is difficult to show someone else a kindness that we haven't learned to show ourselves.

I know some people understand this. I am so grateful for you. I am trying to learn it too.

I am back to writing computer code. Coding is a refuge, all the problems at least make sense. Real life needs breakpoints and unit testing.
