# The Rest of the Story

I just listened to episode 808 of This American Life, it was about a certain voice that was a part of the background hum of my life, as far back as my earliest memories. My mother tuned in to Paul Harvey at exactly noon each day, and we would all "stand by for news!"

For the next 15 minutes, Paul Harvey held us captive with his reporting that seemed both overly dramatic and level-headed at the same time. I was home because I was home schooled. It was a welcome voice that meant I could take a break from my school work and watch the clock on the wall, trying to guess from the time and the cadence of Paul Harvey's voice when he was going to begin The Rest of the Story, a short segment at the end of his show that told a story from the life of an important person. It was often moving or inspiring or had a twist ending where you would find out this person who saw great hardship and adversity was actually a famous person. I bet you never would have guessed that person had that experience, and now you know... (pause for dramatic effect) *The Rest of the Story.*

Every year my parents send out a Christmas letter to all their friends where they talk about the wonderful things that have happened in their lives over the year. If the only record of our family history were these letters, it would seem very rosy. My father usually had his own section called The Rest of the Story which would be a much shorter telling of the events of the year according to just him. And yet, even between these two narratives, a big part of our family story is completely unknown, left out because there are no words that can transform the shame into something you would ever want other people to know.

I am an adult now, and I have always been careful about which parts I share too. It is not just my story, and sharing it could hurt people I care deeply for, who I wish only happiness and healing. Staying silent has deep consequences too, that is a recurring theme in our story. And so we must think and reflect on what we should share and find that balance that might never satisfy anyone else that thinks they could possibly know. I believe that anyone heals only when everyone heals, we are connected beyond our ability to truly sever. This is a lesson we must learn as a species and as communities and as families and as individuals. Each part matters, each part needs love.

As doctoral students in a clinical psychology program, we were advised never to talk about our own mental health struggles. This advice always seemed terrible and I have never followed it. It seemed like the ultimate act of cowardice, we understand the damage caused by the stigma over mental health and yet we are leading the charge when that is the advice we give and the example we show. 

^Marsha Linehan has a valuable perspective on this kind of advice in Building a Life Worth Living.

People are sometimes compared to sheep. I always liked sheep, that didn't seem fair. At our worst, we are more like the huge herds of wildebeasts being circled by lions that you sometimes see in nature documentaries. We desperately try to hide, but that just means someone else will have nobody between them and the lion. This is what I thought of when I got that advice from faculty. 

But I don't believe that is our true spirit, either. 

If there was just one idea I wish that I could beam into the hearts and minds of America it is that you don't need to hide your struggles. That you don't deserve to suffer alone. We must lead with the example we would like to see.

The next part of the episode also felt very relevant to my life. It was about a man that struggled to control his rage and the impact it had on his family and his life. I have faced the rage of others my whole life. I have seen how it echos through generations. I have seen how it isolates and destroys the one who can't control it. I promised myself not to carry that pain onward. But sometimes it knocks on the door. We don't get to choose after inviting it in.

But holding that anger under water is not the answer. There must be a place to put it. There is no where else for me to put it, so I will scatter it here like embers I wish to fade.
