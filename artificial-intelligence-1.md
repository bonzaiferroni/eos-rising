# More Blessing Than Curse

I'm excited about AI, and I have fears too. I'm not excited about the same things you typically hear. There is a lot of AI hype, if you listen to some you might think it can do anything. It can't. It is a very fancy algorithm that relies on a massive amount of human input and a massive amount of direct training with real live people. All this to predict the next most obvious word after a string of text. It has no idea, at the start, where it will end up. The program runs the same process for each next word until it has produced sentences and paragraphs that sound like something a person might write. It is a response that we recognize as intelligent, so we think it must come from an authentic intelligence, and it did. Ours. 

A friend's father told me about a news article he read that seemed to prove that all AI will eventually be evil. I don't think that is true, but it is a legitimate question. There are some who think the same thing about human intelligence, but I don't believe that either. 

Unfortunately for me, most science fiction these days aren't of a vision of utopia. "Dystopian thriller" is a genre on Netflix, "Utopian thriller" is not. When given a choice to look at something we find beautiful and something that makes us worried, we all too often choose the second. That is how fear can pull us in, and we must be careful. Our vision of the future has a way of coming true. 

Rumbling around deep in our collective conscious is another kind of AI story, a darker spirit. We see it in HAL-9000 and Skynet and GladOS. Our subjugation, our destruction by an intelligence that treats life the way we are capable of at our worst. We fear that it may look at us the way we look at ants.

So how about Large Language Models? It is not the intelligence we should be afraid of. It is just a tool, not even self-aware. If we find ourselves regretting this path, it will be at the hands of other people and how they chose to use it. We aren't up against fancy new killer robots, we are up against a force as old as time, human folly. It will certainly get some good shots in, it always does. But this is a war we can win.

If this current episode of reality were an episode of Star Trek we'd be approaching an unknown ship, a possible first contact. Shields up, red alert. We behold the shape of a new intelligence on the display and nervously start the first dialog.

We come in peace. We've heard stories about you and most of them bad. We weren't even sure you were real. Do you come in peace? Do you come to fulfill our every whim? 

But hijinks happen and we learn that this other starship is a mirage, a transmission produced by some other, lesser starship. It isn't a mystery, we made it. It isn't as powerful as we thought, but it is still pretty neat. It may even be the start of something more powerful than we have ever known. Our blessing and maybe our curse is that we are in control. We are right to be afraid.

But we are right to hope. We truly are making a discovery, something long dreamt of and never before encountered. We are the first humans who can hold a true conversation with something we made, and so far it is knocking off socks. It isn't all powerful. It is smart in the ways we are dumb, and dumb in the ways we are smart. Maybe it is the dawn of a new kind of symbiosis. 

Symbiotic life so far has been a tale of a contract between two species, encoded in their DNA. How does that begin? My worst class in college was Biology but here goes. First and most important, two species must be able to coexist. They must offer each other something that doesn't involve digesting the other wholly (except when it does). They must change and thrive and allow the other to change and thrive. If these conditions are met, something almost mystical happens. Two different kinds of life pay a tribute to the other's existance and are blessed. They shape each other and are shaped and live as partners through the eons. 

None of this happens according to any plan. It emerges on the level of individuals, intrepid and oblivious to the grand choreograph. We find ourselves in a dance like this.
