# How to Wonder

*Like Socrates*

It's hard to know where to even start, so I'll visit a question from the last post, and keep doing that until I run out of questions or die of old age.

I told you about my favorite chapter of my favorite book. The name of the chapter is *How to Wonder like Socrates*. I very nearly plagiarized the name of the chapter until I had the insight of putting part of it in the subtitle, problem solved.

What does it mean to wonder? I still don't own a dictionary, but I'm guessing it says something like "to ask questions." People write a lot of glowing things about curiosity, and yet it is never overdone. Many creatures have a curious spirit, and its danger to cats is legendary. Dogs can be very curious about what you are eating, for example. 

Eric Weiner explores the concept of *experiencing* questions. He relates a conversation with another philosopher, Jacob Needleman, that introduced the idea to him. 

"Our culture has generally tended to solve its problems without experiencing its questions."

As a programmer, I can tell you where my mind went-- quick fixes. Fix the exception and move on. Use a library, even if you think your own solution would be a better fit and not too difficult to write. Of course, that is how projects get finished. So they tell me. If I ever finish a project, I will let you know.

^ there's a very easy way to tell if I'm having fun programming: am I in a hurry?

I've learned that life is sublime when we take our time on the question part. Enjoy the state of not knowing. Let everyone around you know that you do not, in fact, know. It's enough, for now. 

In therapy, it might be a little different. Many therapies these days are what they call *solutions focused* and designed to wrap up in just a handful of sessions. They are not so concerned about how you got somewhere but where to go from here. I actually think this is okay, therapy is not an infinite resource, and if something is troubling you *right now* then finding a solution sooner rather than later is just compassionate. However, when personal insights can be uncovered in therapy, it can be life changing.

Of course, friends provide the perfect place to experience these questions-- longtime friends and the kind you just met at the bar or cafe.

Why do we rush to solutions? Humans have a highly evolved discomfort avoidance system-- the envy of our part of the universe-- and having a question without an answer can indeed be uncomfortable.

And here is a weird bug in our source code: avoiding something, even something small, tends to make it bigger in your mind. It becomes habit forming, the relief from the effort to avoid becomes greater and greater, until you can't even imagine yourself doing the thing.

Living with uncertainty is like that.

To be fair, sometimes uncertainty is legitimately scary. But we treat it that way far more often then we need to. The fear of death, for example. They sometimes say, "life is fragile." In some sense, that's not really true, life can be remarkably robust. I've learned that the hard way. If you are like most of us, it's not happening very soon. 

But it *will* happen, and then what happens? I've always thought of it like turning out the lights and immediately falling asleep. Maybe I dream, maybe I don't. I suppose it is the Occam's razor version of the afterlife.

Of course, there are other explanations that involve very beautiful places or very hot places. Or some kind of transformation. These are all fascinating to think about, and perhaps that is how you might experience the question yourself. I just think, whatever we believe, it shouldn't make us more afraid than the vanilla version I described.

Asking questions. Socrates was the king of it-- to the degree that they named a whole method after him which is basically just asking questions. So let's ask questions. Not just ask, experience. 

Weiner suggests a new kind of greeting: "Take your time." If that's where the *Socrates Express* takes us, let's get on board.

This seems like late in the post to talk about the other meaning of wonder, to hold awe. It's how we respond to something wonderful. But really we were talking about that the whole time.

Here is what I try to remember each day: Start at the beginning. Find comfort with uncertainty. Enjoy your stroll toward truth, hope that you do not arrive too soon. 

^ If you are like me, you sometimes get "wander" and "wonder" mixed up. They seem too similar in sound and concept. Am I more like a wondering wanderer or a wandering wonderer? See, now we are both mixed up.
