***Just a heads up, this post briefly touches on issues of abuse and self harm.***

They say to tell any good story, you have to start at the beginning. Then skip to the end. Then tell everything in the middle out of order. I'm pretty sure that's what they say. In any case, that's what I intend to do here.

Before I move on to the end, let me give you a sneak peak about the middle. Please feel free to hear the following in your head with movie trailer voice.

> He planted a garden. He went on dates. He ran out of money. He grew things in his garden and gave them to the dates. Did he think *Stardew Valley* was real life? He went to picnics and dances. He flirted on the bus and at the grocery store. He learned to cook. He took music lessons. He worked on his home. He survived the winter. Did he ever find his Penny? No, what he found instead was a love for footwear and hats. Come see *HNTD: On Colfax*, in theaters this June.

On to the end.

The scene opens and I am in my closet because it feels like the safest part of my home. I'm talking to a friend, we are three hours into the phone call. I'm telling this friend about something that happened to me when I was too young. She led me to this place because something like that happened to her too and she recognized someone that was suffering. 

The phone line beeps and it is another friend. The first friend needs to go be a mom and so she hands me off.

My voice sounds tired because I've been talking a lot over the last 24 hours. I have three friends helping me through a very difficult. 

We eventually hang up and I'm scribbling little notes down in a notebook with a velvet cover and the word SECRETS on the front. I never learned how to be subtle.

I am looking at my shirt off in the mirror because I look different to myself. The smart lights in my bathroom are a retro mix of sea green and purple. Normally, it looks really cool to me. Tonight, I wish they were dumb lights. My hair is sticking up like some kind of mad scientist and that makes me laugh a little which somehow doesn't feel like the appropriate reaction.

I'm worried that my neighbors are worried about me.

I had just written a blog post called *On This Day*. It felt like I could see my life in a very different light for the first time. 

Now I am speaking into my phone in a dark house. Almost everyone on my side of the planet are in bed. I'm recording my thoughts because I want to listen to them later. They do not seem exactly right. 

If I died unexpectedly, I wanted someone to know. I figured that my nephew knows the lock on my phone so at least there's a chance. I'm not sure why I would die, but I find myself weighing the odds that people from space or angels or something are teaching me something very important and after I finally understand and pass it along there might not be any reason to continue existing. This doesn't seem likely, even to me, but the odds that it is true have gone from like one in a million to one in a hundred. According to Nate Silver, that is a perceivable difference.

I am strangely comforted when I am done talking. I've done my part. I join the rest of my side of the planet and close my eyes.

I have a strange dream that I am a little boy stepping out of a large mechanical suit that is supposed to look like a man. Smoke is coming out. 

I can step out because I just found the zipper. I can step out because it is safe right now. There are three animals standing guard around me-- an owl, a mountain lion, and an otter. We are in meadow of a deep, dark forest. I am turning into a fox cub. I lay down and close my eyes. I'm too tired to fix my man suit. I wake up in the dream and the other animals are gone but I feel safer.

I wake up in real life. I see the first rays of sunshine streak through pink clouds. I turn on the computer screen and think about going for a run.

In a few days, things feel more normal. I'm catching up on housework and I feel like working again. It's starting to dawn on me that busking is going to be harder than I thought, and I'm working on programming projects I put down months ago. I'm calling up clients I haven't talked to in a while. 

It feels good to work with code again. 

I stand in front of the window, brushing my teeth looking in the canal outside for my fox family. I notice my former neighbor out there. He used to live below me but now he lives on the other side of Sable. He still comes by to feed the cats in the canal. He feeds the foxes now too, so they won't eat the cat food. Sometimes I see the cats and the foxes playing just like dogs and cats and I wonder if there is a test that can help you rule out whether you are actually in a Disney movie. My neighbor sees me in the window and waves. I wave back, awkwardly.

I'm not dating anymore, mostly as a kindness to myself. I did email the person who painted the bluejay that I found at the thrift store that is hanging beside my guitar. She invited me to her instagram and it is full of her work, she draws wildlife.

I'm still thinking about how to write the first post on the dating blog I was planning. I created the section on Substack last year. I called it *Stardew Valley: IRL* until I could think of something better because that it is too cheesy, even for me. It was also supposed to be about how dating can be easier than it seems. I ponder the ways that's not exactly clear to me in the moment. I try to remember plan b. Was there a plan b?

Work is a little strange. ChatGPT changed everything and no one is quite sure yet if it is a good change. Programmers have always felt safe from the threat of AI taking our jobs. As it turns out, this was a failure of imagination. They didn't quite take our jobs, they just made it a lot easier so they don't need as many programmers. A nail gun can put a lot of hammers out of business. 

If anything, coding was uniquely suited for AI. But we all agree this is a small price to pay for the ability generate, in mere seconds, all our documentation in the voice of a pirate. 

I tell my dermatologist about some disturbing, unwelcome thoughts about self harm, although I'm committed to not acting on them. She helps me find help.

It's the new year and I'm grateful to be on the other side of Christmas. I've gained some pounds but I still fit into my favorite pants. I've been taking Sertraline for about a month. It was a rough start but that thing happened to me where I woke up one day and it felt like colors were a little brighter. I remember reading about that phenomenon as a psychology student and thought about what must be going on in my brain.

The night before the colors got brighter, I had a dream. I remember laughing very hard in my dream at some joke. Part of me knew I was dreaming and I wondered if I would still think it was funny after I wake up.

The joke was this: I would get down on my hands and knees, and start shaking my head back and forth, kind of like you see them do sometimes in a Japanese cartoon.

I was doing this and I was shaking my head back and forth and I was saying, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry" over and over again. But I was laughing, because it was just a joke. Other people saw me doing it and then they started doing it and everyone was in on the joke and laughing. This continued to spread until I was somehow aware that the whole world was doing it, you could hear the roar of "I'm sorry, I'm sorry".

I woke up and I could not understand the joke. But colors seemed a little brighter.

I am thinking about the relationship I was in at the time last year. I missed her very much and I wondered if it would be okay to contact her, just to see how she was doing.

The weather's just starting to get nice but I'm stuck inside. I guess I haven't left the house in a few weeks. I ran out of my prescription and the robot from CVS keeps calling me. 

I would never hurt myself because I understand the burden it would place on my family. I do not want to hurt them. I think about how it would feel to lose any one of them. 

But it doesn't seem like anyone could blame me if I just died of dehydration. How hard is it not to drink water long enough to be serious? I guessed it would be really hard but worth a try. 

A few hours have passed and I am getting bored. I decide there are a few things I would like to pass on before I go. The last year was difficult but I feel strangely clear about some things. It makes me sad to think about no one understanding why I left. I wrote `the-cold.md` and uploaded it to a github repository. I put the link to the file in a gmail to a friend and scheduled it to send on my birthday next year. I could just cancel the scheduled send if I needed to.

I was pretty sure this dehydration thing wasn't going to work because I kept forgetting and getting water from my refrigerator out of habit. I realized I was okay with that, and it felt good. 

The next day I looked at what I had wrote and cried. I thought about a more hopeful ending. I changed the title to *Beyond Shame* and uploaded it to my blog. I checked my calendar and I was grateful to see I hadn't missed my doctor's appointment. I took a walk along the Highline Canal for the first time in months, looking for my foxes. 

By the time I got home I had a new name for my dating blog and I had begun to remember plan b.
