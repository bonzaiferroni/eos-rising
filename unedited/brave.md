# Bravery and Bravado

I heard about BRAVE Church from someone on the missions team at Highline Community Church. I heard it was one church that was thriving even as other churches are experiencing dwindling numbers. Indeed, most of the churches I have visited were only half full with a predominantly older demographic, sometimes I am the only person in my age group. I would really like to understand this trend. Is church less relevant to people's lives? Or is it just a part of a much wider trend of community disengagement in our society? I decided BRAVE was my next church to visit, to see if I can learn anything. 

On my quest, I wear a couple hats. I am a member of HCC missions team and we wish to understand what might bring more community engagement. And I still wear the hat that I wore stepping into HCC, I'm curious about the role of community in our society as a whole and this particular moment of disengagement, what they sometimes call the loneliness epidemic. 

In my personal life, I feel lucky to have a few very good friends that keep in touch. I have lots of family nearby and nieces and a nephew that make life fun. But I understand on a personal level what they mean by the loneliness epidemic. I am single and I work from home. 

When I go out, I usually find it easy to make connections, if I mind my manners and don't scare everyone off right away. I can blend in well enough in almost any setting. I read people well and I know how to be patient and how to listen. That is really all it takes, it works so well that it (usually) makes up for the social graces that I do lack. I am a programmer, after all. Anyone who has worked with programmers understands, we are not known for our social graces. 

Before I started visiting churches, I was in a phase of exploring other social activities. I was going to picnics and dances and other events that I found through social media. I joined a community garden.

I've always been interested in people and the life of the mind. It is why I chose psychology as a major. I had a very different educational experience, growing up. I had to learn many things on my own, both in school and in my personal life. This has given me a slightly uneasy relationship with other people. It's easy for me to make mistakes through simply not knowing what people usually do. I am also more sincere than people are sometimes expecting, because sincerity went out of style to some degree but not all of us like that. You could think of it as farmboy syndrome. 

There are many ways that I think believers have the right idea. A focus on community is one of them. I think we are all basically like prairie dogs, we need others around to feel whole. The community provides a very important benefit to the individual, and the individual gives back to the community. It is basically how we are wired, and when it happens in a healthy way, we flourish. 

When it comes to community, I think believers have a particular advantage, in this moment. So much of the church experience is about maintaining community. The secular culture has become extremely individualistic, to a very unhealthy degree. Self-reliance is pushed to an unrealistic place. We are self-absorbed and it only seems to be increasing as a trend. It is where loneliness epidemics come from. Other cultures may have it even worse, but each culture experiences it differently. In any case, it is not going well for us.

The U.S. has a particular advantage: we are a nation of immigrants. Some of the best people in the world were attracted to the best things about us. They brought the best parts of the cultures they knew, the Danish brought hygge. ChatGPT explains:

> Hygge (pronounced "hoo-ga") is a Danish concept that embodies coziness, comfort, and contentment. It's all about creating a warm atmosphere and enjoying the good things in life with good people. Think soft blankets, candles, and intimate gatherings with friends and family. Aye, it's about making the everyday moments more meaningful.

And so, we can learn the best parts of each other. I believe we are at our best when we express the spirit of Lady Liberty. Few messages in human history have inspired hope like hers. It was radical and good and we never have to take it back, even when sometimes people would like to.

Since ancient times, religion and belief played a critical role in how we came together as a community. I have been exploring the work of Emile Durkheim, particularly his understanding of collective effervescence. I'll let ChatGPT explain:

> Arr, collective effervescence be the surge of energy that mates feel when gathered for a spirited event, like a hearty festival or a sacred ceremony. Dreamt up by the sociologist Émile Durkheim, it explains how these gatherings can forge a sense of unity and shared identity among the crew. It's marked by a high tide of excitement and togetherness, making everyone feel part of a grander voyage, often strengthening the bonds and values of the group.

Many religions have tapped into this pathway of human experience, although it is not exclusive to that world. The church experience has something in common with the concert experience and the sporting event experience. There's a certain energy to the air that is hard to describe, a togetherness. Whatever emotions emerge, we experience them together. When it is a healthy expression, we are never more beautiful.

This might sound a little basic, but I happen to think it begins by simply acknowledging that other people are there. In our modern world, it is strange how you can feel so alone among a huge crowd of people. I think it is because we spend so much energy pretending that other people aren't there. There might be understandable reasons why we might want to do that, but it is at least noteworthy how pleasant *not* doing that can be. 

Sure enough, one thing you typically do at a Sunday service is take a moment to greet everyone around you. This is usually a mix of true warmth and awkwardness, everyone brings what they have to the table. When it happens at its best, everyone feels an invitation to togetherness. There are other social highlights to the church experience. Singing together. Praying together. Chuckling at pastor jokes together. Experiencing emotions together seems to be the basis for the sense of togetherness. As chaotic as human emotion can be, it makes sense that we have an instinct that brings us in sync with other people. This togetherness instinct is the engine that drives the religious experience, but I believe it runs much deeper than that. It is possible to feel held, within that experience, for the weight of the world to seem lighter. They call it fellowship.

It is possible to find something like this experience outside of church. Concerts and sporting events and other community events have their own version of togetherness. Sometimes it can be a part of a work culture. Large family gatherings, neighborhood barbecues, the local bar.

But churches usually hold at least one advantage: their intention to be inclusive. I say "intention" because they sometimes fall short, because inclusivity is not always as simple as we hoped. They still get a lot of credit for me for having the intention, that's rare enough on its own. 

Inclusiveness, it is not always easy to navigate. That is why we have the spirit of hygge, the warm part of the human spirit that can be found in so many cultures. It is the same warm spirit that swept me into so many family gatherings when backpacking through Mexico. I think the American culture has their own version of this spirit, we have a pulse too. Unfortunately, we are extremely creative in finding new ways to charge people money. We are also very conscious of status, and among our elite, exclusivity is celebrated. 

I think the hygge spirit is the answer for churches that wish to cultivate stronger communities and make progress on their mission. I decided to give each church I visited a hygge rating, and when I went with a friend I would ask for their hygge rating too.

I wondered if BRAVE church had any answers to these questions, if I would find a strong spirit of hygge there or something else.

Jesus understood hygge. He might be washing your feet, replicating you a meal of fish and bread, making sure your wedding party doesn't go dry, healing your disease, or offering you words of strength and hope when you feel downtrodden. One thing is for sure, he loved people and he showed it the way we all understand, no matter when or where we lived. He called for us to do the same, it is basically our only job. "Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."

The about how it would feel, after you've been walking in the desert, barefoot or with sandals, to dip your feet into cool water, to feel the warm hands of the kindest man you had ever seen, smiling up at you, wishing you nothing but comfort and happiness and to ease of your burden. That's off the hygge richter scale. 

Jesus purposefully took a position of humility, why? Perhaps because a position of superiority, in privilege and power, is antithetical to his message. It is antithetical to the way we are called to approach each other.

In many aspects, BRAVE church gets a high hygge rating. I met a friend there and we sat near an older woman who welcomed us warmly. My friend reminded her of her daughter and we were soon sharing personal stories and details. 

The praise and worship at BRAVE is like Coldplay concert, and I mean that in the best possible way. The singers and musicians project an energy that resonates within the congregation. Durkheim would describe the spirit in the room as *collective effervescence*. ChatGPT, describe collective effervescence:

> Arr, collective effervescence be the surge of energy that mates feel when gathered for a spirited event, like a hearty festival or a sacred ceremony. Dreamt up by the sociologist Émile Durkheim, it explains how these gatherings can forge a sense of unity and shared identity among the crew. It's marked by a high tide of excitement and togetherness, making everyone feel part of a grander voyage, often strengthening the bonds and values of the group.

We were right down in front, where it is easiest to get swept up in the spirit. It meant we also were able to see the little boy that was standing right up in front of the stage with a guitar, facing the singers and playing along with them, behind him a hundred voices praising God. That moment is etched in my memory. A powerful spirit sometimes chooses to show itself in the form you might least expect, and today it was a little boy with a guitar. 

I believe we visited three times. The first time, the boy was alone up there, in front of the congregation, facing the singers. Afterward, I talked to a couple members of the praise team and they told me that the boy likes to hang out when they practice and they showed him the chords to the songs. 

The second time we visited, the boy again stood up there and played his guitar when the singers came out on stage. Only this time, teenagers came up to stand beside him on either side. After the service, I did go up there to shake his hand. His mother told me a little bit about how they were struggling as a family and how much it meant to him to play music with the band. They told me that this was BRAVE church and I could finally see what they meant.

A year later, I visited BRAVE church again. I wanted to see if this little boy was leading the praise team yet. Unfortunately, he was nowhere in sight. 

My friend, Claudia, who welcomed us a year ago was still there, and she saved me a seat when I told her I was visiting again. It was nice to catch up with her and hear a little more about her life.

There is another aspect that BRAVE church does not get a very high hygge rating, and that is the sermon. It was delivered by the same pastor that we heard last year. I remember, at the time, my friend said that the message felt angry to her, unwelcoming. I felt the same way. 

I'm gonna let you judge for yourself, you [can watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz8FSTAV5yc) the sermon that I saw today. Here is a sermon I saw [last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbzUbsHxE-Y). What do they have in common? One thing is clear, Pastor Jeff Schwarzentraub is deep in the trenches of the culture wars. 

There are a lot of things to talk about in this sermon. On the brighter side, I think the call to hope was effective. Right now, it seems like there is a scarcity of hope. I think hope is one of the best reasons to go to church, and if a church doesn't offer it, find a new church. 

There was a call to many other things. There was a call to division. There was a call to resistance to what the Christian church sees as persecution. I think it is difficult for the Christian church in the U.S. to see that it still holds the most envied position of power and privilege of any church in the history of the earth. The spirit of gratitude is not strong within the Christian church. You would certainly not guess, the way they talk about their outlook for the future, that the almighty God of the universe is on their side.

True, Christianity has seen some cultural decline. Perhaps there are teachable lessons here, or perhaps the right way is pearl clutching and doubling down on grievances. I think if you ask Pastor Jeff, we must double down on the grievances. 

Here's my takeaway, as a non-believer visiting BRAVE Church. Your welcome is not for me. Your welcome is for people who feel timid, people who don't understand the true meaning of strength. You might help them feel safer, with your strong words against the people you see as ungodly. Your welcome is for people looking for bravery but who don't understand what real bravery is. You don't understand bravery, you only understand bravado. 

ChatGPT, what is the difference between bravery and bravado?

> Ahoy! Bravery be the genuine act of facing danger or pain with courage, while bravado is all about showin' off, often with a bluff of bravery when one's actually quakin' in their boots. Bravery comes from the heart, bravado from the desire to impress the crew.

Bravado wins battles, bravery wins wars. Bravery is the little boy in front of the whole congregation playing his heart out, bravado is the pastor with a persecution complex and a long list of grievances. 

It's noteworthy that BRAVE church is the kind of church that is thriving in the current political climate, and it is certainly tapped into that climate. People in the grip of fear will sometimes seek out a strongman. It's effective, by some metrics. It's possible that they are meeting all their goals. But I think that if Jesus was in Denver, BRAVE church would be the last place he would choose to spend his Sunday, or at least he would quietly exit after the praise and worship.

Within the sermon were strong statements in support of Israel. No mention of the people in Gaza. As far as I could tell, they might as well not even exist in the minds of BRAVE church. They may think it is fine to look away. Would Jesus look away? That's how you know you joined a losing side, it is a side that is unwilling to stand up for its principles when the moment really matters. It is a side that is champing at the bit to reassure you that you are right about all your political fears.
