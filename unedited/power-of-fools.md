# The Power of Fools

*How to be effectively bonkers*

Alas, Dear Sapiens, we are but fools. This is an inescapable fact of our species. Nature has blessed us with an awareness of right and wrong that is most clear after the second one. It's no reason to be ashamed, it is life that makes fools out of us. To be fair, sometimes we collaborate with life to that end.

There's good news, being a fool is not as bad as you've heard. Heck, sometimes we even get close to recognizing its value. Mark Twain is among the greatest Americans to ever live, and he also made terrible business decisions, squandered whole fortunes, and frequently embarrassed his family with his antics. His wife, who loved him dearly, would sometimes throw up her hands and exclaim, "oh youth!"

Mark Twain was ahead of his time in so many ways. He was a pioneer as a social justice warrior. He is thought to be first American mega-celebrity. He was a fashion genius, thanks to him we have white suits. 

There is also the idea of the holy fool. My favorite brother Karamazov was Alyosha, but then again everyone loves Alyosha. 

Lest I sound like a reductionist, it is important to see that we are much more than fools. The foolish part of us is only a part of us. We also have a dignified part that sometimes outshines the rest. 

Part of the problem is that people think of foolishness and ridiculousness as the same thing. They are not. I don't have a dictionary but I'd guess that the definition of ridiculous is something like "deserving of ridicule" and fool is something like "lacking good judgment." Do you see the difference? This seems to me like an eye of the beholder problem.

I don't think anyone deserves ridicule. That might sound radical, but let's think about it. First, let them that have never lacked judgment cast the first stone. Second, how does it help? Please contact me and tell me the story where ridicule and mockery solved the problem. Even if there was a possible scenario, that is not where our true power resides. It is much more likely that we only bring ourselves low.

There are a couple varieties of fool that we should avoid channeling. 

There is the serious fool. I'm thinking Alex Jones. He is not tethered to dignity in any shape or form, but he uses this power for bad things. He seems to lack a healthy sense of humor. He always steers the story to a dark place. I am watching *The Truth vs Alex Jones* and it is difficult.

Let us test our stand against ridicule, for if anyone deserves ridicule, it is the Alex Joneses of the world. Do you still feel like it? I honestly do not. He certainly deserves consequences. Hopefully not the kind that take away his humanity and dignity but rather give him an opportunity to find it again. Rather than ridicule, I would much rather understand what is driving the behavior. If there was ever an opportunity where I could offer him compassion, I would try it in a heartbeat. I've seen it do miracles.

If there was an alignment chart of fools, the opposite of Alex Jones would be Robin Williams. Also not tethered to dignity. But rather than take the story to a dark place, he took it somewhere funny or beautiful or true. A lovely man.

There is the bitter fool. Life sometimes gives us a lot of reasons to be bitter. Perhaps we see no reason to have dignity when nobody treats us with dignity. We act the fool as a bizarre punishment. We become like the Joker.

Why do we tether ourselves to dignity? An effective fool sees that people put on that leash try to hide reality. An effective fool sees all the ways that people try to seem sophisticated and then makes a very wise decision: don't. It comes as a huge relief. For one thing, it takes a lot of effort and focus to maintain the charade. We could be focusing on something that matters more. And more importantly, it has a way of draining the fun out of life.

If we could truly tether ourselves to dignity, it might be worthwhile. The problem is, whenever we aim to do so, we tether ourselves to something else.

Occasionally we might find ourselves near dignity anyway, almost by accident. The spirit of dignity within us leads us there, it turns out we didn't need the tether. These moments are beautiful.

An effective fool has a deeper connection to humanity.

This morning I was walking to a bus stop on Colfax and I walked by a man who was bending over to look for cigarettes. His hair and his clothes were unwashed. I was listening to my headphones and he said something to me.

"What was that?" I said, taking off one ear.

"How is Gary doing?" he said, standing up and walking along beside me.

"I don't think I know a Gary."

"I thought your brother's name was Gary." He seemed genuinely surprised.

"My brother's name is John." I replied. (Shout out to Dan too.)

"Oh, you mean Big John?" he said, and put his arms out to illustrate.

"Yes, he is big!" I said, and we both laughed and held our arms out as we walked down the sidewalk. 

As we began to walk in different directions he looked over at me and smiled. "That's what I love about you," he said, as we waved goodbye.

I don't hear that very often. It honestly made me feel great and I held on to his spirit as I danced, waiting for the bus.
