I haven’t always felt free to talk about my spiritual beliefs, so I feel a little wobbly doing so now. I’ve learned to keep them to myself, most of the people in my life who are interested in spirituality are not interested in my spirituality. When I have shared my beliefs fully, the Christians in my life respond with anything from mild discomfort to interventions to outright hostility. 

I understand where they are coming from, I once believed all the same things. One belief that was a relief to put aside was the importance of changing another’s belief about God when you think it is wrong. It always made me uncomfortable to “witness”, not because I was ashamed about being a follower of Jesus, but the tone-deaf audacity of it. It felt like superiority, to me, arrogance. Devout followers of other religions believe they’ve been given the truth, too. It’s like coming to a potluck and everyone has brought a pie. It takes a certain kind of arrogance to stand across from someone and claim your pie is the only true pie before anyone has even had a slice.

If there was a kind of “witnessing” that resonated with me, it was based on the idea that actions speak louder than words. The best way to spread the love of Jesus is to just spread love and let other people ask for the details if they are interested.
