# Our Problem With Supremacy

America, we have a supremacy problem. As a country, we have embraced the idea that it is not enough to just be good, we must be the best. 

Let's think about why we have embraced supremacy. The military might of the United States has provided the context for a lasting peace among certain nations that have a history of conflict. 

White supremacy. Male supremacy. Female supremacy. That is something we now face, for understandable reasons. Collectively, men seem to be struggling, while women have blazed a steady trail of progress for generations.

Supremacy is the delusion of a mind that feels weak and helpless.

It is not enough to be good. You must be the best.

This is why a wise philosophy teaches humility. There is frailty in the spirit of supremacy.

People with a superiority problem regularly bask in self-praise for unmerited achievements.
