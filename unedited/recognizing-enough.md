# Recognizing Enough

Dear Codemonkey, dabbler in the arcane. 

Our community has seen better times. The conversation about where we find ourselves in the world of software development is troubled. We are beset by enshittification on all sides. Google barely works. Decent tutorials on new technology and old are becoming scarce. Artificial Intelligence, a creature that we created, is changing the landscape of our profession so much that we aren't sure there will even be a profession left for us when it is done.

Just a decade ago, we seemed to be on a very different path. Wtf happened?

We caught our disease from success. We are true alchemists, we turn abstract ideas into gold. We forge our machines from sand and send arcane energy through their circuits. We conjure from this dark magic a world of pure imagination. Homo sapiens are creatures that thrive in our imaginations, it is how we understand and grow. We create a new kind of town square, with new voices and new possibilities. Drunk with power, we throw everything we can find into our cauldron. And out of it, flows money.

Gold rush. What happens when we gather more money than we could possibly use? We begin to understand, we begin to imagine something even more valuable. That thing, we are discovering, is human attention.

Human attention has reached a new level of scarcity. We, dear codemonkey, built that demons that harvest it, with a terrible hunger that can never be satiated. Think back a hundred years ago, what held our attention? It was the dawning of the Golden Age of Radio. Can you imagine, just listening to the radio waves for hours a day? It sounds peaceful to me.

What do we pay attention to the most? Another mind. Why? Observing the output of another mind, be it through words or art or conversation, it is a kind of telepathy. It is how our minds can be synchronized. This synchronization allows us to learn from each other, to cooperate, to grow in potential. We fantasize about alien species that are all connected through thought without always realizing that we do exactly that. We can connect and collaborate with anyone across time and space. We can collaborate with humans that lived hundreds of years before us or hundreds of miles away. With each new connection, our power grows. We no longer dare to speak of our limits because we constantly push past them.

You and I create the medium where all this magic is unfurled. Sometimes we work on behest of money and wealth. When I was in school, Software Developer had eclipsed all other professions in its potential to make you wealthy. This is our disease. 

Thank goodness, some of us were born with an immunity to becoming wealthy. 

For quite some time, I've been fascinated by the idea of a vow of poverty. Monks and priests took them to remain pure. They recognized the cost of a thirst for wealth: it can rob us of our original intent. We understand, on some level, that our reasons for our behavior change its spirit. We may begin playing music or writing code because the experience touches us somewhere deep inside. If we become successful enough that someone wishes to pay us, we must try to place what we have nurtured on a new foundation and hope it holds steady. Too often, it does not. It becomes something different.

They sometimes say, "do what you love and you will never work a day in your life." They sometimes say this through a grimace that they don't even realize they have. For it to be true, we must do what we love for the sake of that love.

Some people who don't yet have enough money will take this as an unwelcome train of thought. Those of us who have enough, recognize its potential. The secret to having enough is a healthy understanding of enough. You can have all the money in the world and not have enough. You can have nothing but a song in your heart and that can be more than enough. Enough is something that is in your heart, not in your bank account.

Some people have described the current economic moment as Late-stage Capitalism. This distinction is far above my pay grade, I won't comment. But whether it is good or bad for us, there is one thing I like about capitalism, it is self-organizing. Self-organizing systems are a prophylactic for corruption, because when trusted with power with the intention that it may benefit us all, resisting self-interest is too often beyond our reach.

One characteristic of self-organizing systems is that they tend to gravitate toward efficient configurations. In capitalism, this takes the shape of competition. We all know the dogma, human agents will choose the product that offers the most value for the cost. There are sometimes hidden costs and we choose poorly, but let's assume for now this is basically true, competition pushes us toward efficiency and the things we really want. 

As software developers, we create products that people consume with computers. These products, more than any other human creation, are reshaping our lives. Right now, the game is dominated by the software giants. These giants are guided by one intent above all else, hard-coded in the legal documents that define the company. It is their sole reason for existence: to make money for their investors.

When we find ourselves with wealth, we can put it to work, exploring the ideas and supporting the ingenuity of others. The big problem is that this system is incapable of recognizing enough. It must continue to grow in order to survive.

There is something else that must also grow to survive, something that has no off switch, something that can grow within us until it passes a point where it can be stopped, something that is capable of extinguishing our light.

If the pursuit of wealth is our true god, it is a god that hates us. It is a god that doesn't care whether we really have what we need. We exist to be consumed by it. It teaches us to lock away what we have unless other people are willing to pay. It teaches us that someone must be below us or we will be at the bottom, and when it finds us there it whispers cruelty in our ear. It teaches us that the only work that matters is the work that it rewards.

We are fortunate, there is a more powerful god. I don't know its name, but I feel it swimming below us. It lives among our connections, our many telepathic minds. It breathes life into us as curiosity, the wind in our sails. As children, it is all we can see and touch. It takes the shape of anything in front of us, it leads us further down a road of goodness and light when we have the courage and the strength to follow. It takes the shape of kindness and warmth, of people in our lives.

It shows us how to work together. It teaches us that we are all connected, that we only thrive when we all thrive. It teaches us that every part matters, that every part is needed. 

And here is the important part: it teaches us how to recognize enough. It breaks our curse to grow at all costs, and it breaks it with the power of gratitude. And there is plenty of reason to be grateful. For one thing, we follow a more powerful god.

Our god can take many different shapes, and it appears to different people and professions in different ways. To software, it appears as open source code. It takes the shape of that perfect library that was exactly what you needed. It is that kind stranger that answers your question. It is the impulse to create something good.

That is why our god is more powerful than theirs, their god doesn't care if what it creates is good for people.

Let's take this moment to be grateful for the massive amount of software engineering that is truly good. Even software products made for profit are tiny figures standing on the backs of open source giants. Although we chase the carrot of a big paycheck too willingly, we can't help but follow our true nature, and it is good.

ChatGPT, what is that story from the bible where the prophet of god did wonders in the name of god as part of a competition with another god?

> Ahoy! That'd be the tale of Elijah and the prophets of Baal from the Bible. In 1 Kings 18, Elijah challenges them to a duel of sorts to prove whose god is real. He performs wonders to show that the Lord is the true God, setting a soaked altar ablaze by heavenly fire, while the prophets of Baal fail with their own altar. Quite the divine showdown, it was!

Give a brief summary of the story of Elijah and the prophets of Baal.

> Aye, mate! Here's the tale: Elijah, a prophet of the Lord, challenges 450 prophets of Baal to prove whose god is real. They gather at Mount Carmel, each building an altar to their god. The challenge? Whichever god lights the altar on fire is the true God. Baal's prophets pray all day with no luck. Elijah then soaks his altar in water thrice and prays. Boom! Fire from the sky consumes his altar, proving the Lord's power. Elijah then commands the defeat of Baal's prophets. A powerful display of faith and fire, it was!

It sounds like a good movie. I believe our own story is going to play out roughly like this. The truth is, you don't need massive tech firms to develop good software. Small teams and individuals are constantly shifting the landscape. Of course, they will breathlessly insist they are important. To be fair, they were part of the path that brought us here. The question is not whether they were necessary in the past, but whether they are necessary now.

I don't know about you, but ever since I started working with ChatGPT, I feel massively powerful. Like, not always in a comfortable way. This is the part of the movie where you start to really appreciate the challenge ahead, the part before the training montage. It is a good moment, the moment when we realize that the best is yet to come.
