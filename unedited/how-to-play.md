# How to Play

It was important for me to write that article defending foolishness because I'm about to sound like one, a lot. I'd like to use this How to Play section to explore some of life's more difficult questions from the perspective of game design. 

I took only a single philosophy course at school, and instead of talking about philosophy, my professor used most of the lecture to tell us about a woman that was killed by indigenous people, someone that came out to Colorado during the pioneer days. I believe he was involved with her archaeological find. He read all her letters. I think he might have been in love. When he wasn't talking about this woman, he was talking about his divorce or flirting with the students in the front row. 

To be fair, maybe I just didn't understand the connection, he always claimed that it somehow related to the course content but it felt like a stretch to me.

So there wasn't much philosophy in my one course on philosophy.

And I'm not even particularly well read for someone who wants to talk about these subjects. But the last philosophy book I read might be my favorite book of all time, *The Socrates Express* by travel writer and philosopher Eric Weiner. The book has a beautiful chapter about the philosopher its title. Socrates understood that the path of a philosopher will sometimes appear foolish, sometimes genuinely so. It is not a role that lends itself to dignity as much as you might hope.

Here, let's let ChatGPT explain it:

What I believe I can add to the discussion is the perspective of an outsider. I didn't get much philosophy at school but I got a lot of psychology, and that is philosophy adjacent. I also grew up in a very strange world, sometimes it was as if I were on another planet. Many psychology students acknowledge their choice of major has at least something to do with making sense of their own mental health experience.

I have always been interested in people and difficult questions. It is a path that started at church, when I was a young person. It took me through a bachelors and 4/5 of a doctorate. Then it took a very strange turn into software and game design. So, all my life, I've been working on a model of the human experience, from the perspective of religion, psychology, therapy, and game design.

It makes me a little nervous to think about what I plan to write about. It will sometimes be personal and raw, as you might expect from difficult issues. But I also hope the bigger part of it will be fun and no heavier than it needs to be. One of life's graces is that the more we find understanding, the lighter the burden seems to be. I love to imagine a brighter future where we have grown enough to have our head in the clouds and our feet on the ground.

Sometimes I will offend people. This is never on purpose. I put a lot of thought into my words because I want to be a good ambassador for my perspective, so that my delegation will be received warmly. Because it is not just about satisfying curiosity, we are experiencing a little turbulence as a society. We can never hope to completely avoid turbulence but how it is experienced depends on how it is understood.

It is a perspective that I think people will find very hopeful. If you take nothing else away here except a greater sense of hope, that's a great outcome.

I am a strange kind of hermit, the kind that actually loves people. I learned all my social skills in a strange way. The first part of my life, it was almost entirely from my family and church and neighborhood kids. I had no teachers, outside of family and church. That environment was not always healthy or safe. 

Then, in my freshmen year, I went to high school. It was like stepping onto another planet and I felt like I had to catch up in a lot of ways, academically and socially, and very quickly. As if overnight, I developed a way of fitting into social situations that was always a little clumsy and yet I could talk to anyone. But I also struggled with the image of myself as reflected through other people.

I remember at a young age, watching a video with some other kids, and someone I was pretty good friends with told me I looked like this one kid in the video. I was shocked, and when I looked in the mirror, I could see it too. It was as if I didn't recognize my own face very well until that moment. This might sound silly, but it was a vivid experience for me. Perhaps related to this experience, I have always struggled with body image problems. 

I have a few other perceptual problems. Do you know someone who says they never forget a face? Think of me as the opposite of that. One time, I thought I recognized my girlfriend at an Avalanche game so I sat down next to her, expecting to surprise her, and that was a little awkward. I have a lot of little stories like that. If my brain were software I'd be looking for bugs in the image recognition module.

Most people find me friendly, and I can connect easily. What they might not know is that it is partly out of necessity, I sometimes don't recognize someone's face until we start talking. I hate the idea of accidentally passing a friend like I do not know them, so I offer a little bit of familiarity to almost every interaction. You'd think that might get strange but no one has ever complained, much more often it ends up as a little dance of sorts.

I am fun to go out with because, as clumsy as I am sometimes, we can go almost anywhere and talk to anyone and usually end up with a new friend.

However, there are still times that I struggle socially where other people seem to have no problem. I can be so insecure at all the wrong times. Sometimes I feel like a man child. Sometimes I become self absorbed to the point where it drains all the color from life.

Thankfully, it seems to wear itself out, and people can be very understanding. They hardly even noticed, they say.

I'm quirky. But whenever I speak with friends or family about these heavy things, the most common response is relating on a level the surprises us both. It almost seems like the typical story arc of the human experience is about growing enough to see outside of yourself and to recognize a little clearer the human spirit in the people around you and see something familiar.

To help me navigate life, I've developed a few little tricks. When I've shared them, they seem to help others just as much. They come from my experience as a researcher and a therapist, but other places too, like games. If there are any lessons to be learned, that is what I hope to uncover in this section-- the game mechanics of life.
