## Beliefs on the Shore

My childhood was a very spiritual experience. My mother is a very sweet, smaller woman. She is not physically intimidating, but spend just a few moments with her and you may begin to understand the size of her spirit, and yet that is just the tip of the iceberg.

Some people have stories of extremely religious parents who were oppressive. That is not my story. The extremely religious part, yes, but not the oppressive part, not exactly. My childhood was sometimes like a fairy tale, sometimes the happy kind and sometimes the more ancient kind of fairy tale that is dark and haunts you as you try to find sleep.

I eventually broke out of the dense forest of the spirituality I was offered as a child. Or, at least that is how I experienced it. I understand they may have experienced it differently. When we talk of these things, they speak to me like someone they care for who is lost. In their eyes, I was only walking into a forest. 

For many years, I experienced life as a non-spiritual person. I love science. I love that it has answers that I can evaluate objectively. It brought a sanity to my life that felt like walking into the sunshine. I cherished it's promise, that I don't need to believe anything without an objective, compelling reason. I don't need to believe just because it is written. In fact, especially not that.

This worked well for me for quite some time. I thought I had all the big answers that I needed. I wasn't expecting that at the age of 40, I would feel a deep longing for more spirituality in my life. 

I visited churches only to find that my memories of church were, in some ways, very different from the churches I found. In some ways, they were very much the same. I can't re-embrace Christianity any more than I can un-see something terrible that happened right in front of my eyes. But maybe I can understand the parts that I found beautiful and the parts that I miss.

It is not just Christianity, it is any religion. It is just not how I arrive at a strong belief. I must take the bus of objectivity, and it just doesn't have a stop there. I have seen how important it is in our lives. Anything that opposes our proven tools for reality testing will eventually hurt us.

But not every belief needs to be strong belief. We make practical use of vague belief every day. If I hear someone in my hall, I believe it is probably my neighbor because 95% of the time that is true. If I want to talk, it would make sense to open my door and poke my head out. 

The more important a belief is, the more we would like to be certain about it. Questions related to God and our place in the universe are, indeed, important. They are big-picture important. On the other hand, uncertainty about God is not the kind of uncertainty that usually makes us uneasy or afraid. It is uncertainty about whether we can afford rent this month. If God created the universe, they did not make awareness of their existence more important than food and shelter. If it is a puzzle they left for us, it is one that they gave us time to work on.

For some beliefs, Christianity offers no wiggle room and it also has an expectation of certainty, no floating by on vague belief. Any spiritual belief system that I might adopt must be compatible with my heart, which is comfy with vague belief and still curious.

To feel a connection with the spiritual, we don't need belief or even intent. I wrote about a spiritual experience that I had on the bus, of all places. Spirituality, to feel like a part of something big and mysterious, is just a part of the human experience. But even when it is experienced without belief, it sometimes leaves beliefs behind, like seashells on the beach left by a sweeping wave. Just like sea shells, we can pick the beliefs up and wonder about them and put them in our pockets.

When I was a Christian, it was important to spread the beliefs I was given. It was the most important thing I could do. Laying down that burden forever was liberating. There was something about it that always made me uneasy. It was the condescension. My beliefs are inherently correct and any incompatible belief that you have must be mistaken. Ignore those perfectly good ways that we could evaluate our different beliefs. I'm just right, and it is important that you believe it or you will go to hell. There could be nothing more foolish than rejecting these beliefs that I offer you.

Most of the time, we didn't say it like that. But everything we said, particularly amongst ourselves, danced around that mindset.

I offer my spiritual beliefs, now, much differently. They are just like seashells or fossils or arrowheads that I found. You can look at them all you want, but what they mean to you is yours entirely. Of course, if you find them beautiful, that is something we can share. But maybe they just look like rocks to you. I do not mind, it only adds to the mystery.
