If Psychology has something like a holy grail, it is the concept of flow. Perhaps you know of flow, or maybe you know of something that sounds very familiar given your discipline or belief system or even just your day-to-day life. So, flow is psychology's version of that thing. When something we come across is at once new and familiar to us, it is an interesting sign.

What is flow? It is the experience of being *in the zone*. All your attention is on one thing. Your attention is comfortably contained. There is enough room for it to expand and yet there are boundaries that give it a shape, the exact shape that it wishes to be. Everything feels needed, everything feels like enough.

Sounds great, you may be thinking, please enroll me in the beta testing. Unfortunately, it can be elusive. I believe each person has a unique path to flow. It's possible that one person's path would take someone else in the wrong direction. It is really an ancient human rite of passage, echoed in many stories and myths. 

In many of these myths, there is a guide. It could be an animal spirit. Nature is full of ancient wisdom. It could be your nemesis, perhaps the version of you that you must overcome.

What are the hallmarks of flow? I plan to cover that in these posts as I review the literature, it has been a little while and I'm certain it hasn't stayed put. Instead, I can describe my own experience of flow, it is the one version on which I am an authoritative source. 

I can reach a flow state rather dependably given enough time and quiet. A few details are necessary. Whatever I am doing cannot feel rushed. There is sometimes a moment when I really I need to hurry on something and it breaks my heart because I know a certain spirit within just had to quietly step away from the table. 

Time constraints are not always a problem, in fact they can even provide a useful limitation. It is only necessary that I feel like there should be *enough* time. It can even be fun to challenge myself by doing something faster than before. It can feel like running at a full sprint and never getting tired. Perhaps what matters most is that I am running toward something-- a better score, an important milestone. Running just to keep up, or running away from something has a very different feeling.

I believe each time I reach a flow state, it is because I had a guide. Something outside of myself to gently guide me. It could be some way that I am needed. I have unique skills that the world around me sometimes needs. Willingness and want line up perfectly and there is a beautiful reaction that consumes them both.

The guide might be as simple as an unusually beautiful morning, warm sunshine and the scent of spring flowers carried by the breeze. An act of kindness. An exciting discovery. Something takes my hand. Yes, let's. 

Oh, where did the time go? It is eight hours later. Maybe I find myself exactly where I expected to be. More often, I'm in another part of the forest. But the journey feels right and I go about setting up camp.

While I work, I am free. The need for food and company be come distant voices I hear through a quiet radio or a water pipe. 

I am present in the moment, and the moment is present in me. Whenever I find myself wandering away from the moment, I gently lead myself back like you would a restless child. There is something in the moment I must track, something always new. I may try to predict its shape or position in the next moment, but it is always important to look.

I am fully in my body. I notice areas of tension. It helps to go through a series of body scans where I notice the area holding the most tension and invite it to let go. The tension runs to another corner, some other area in my body. It has favorite hiding places until I catch on and it finds new places. But with each intention to let go, my tension becomes smaller and softer until it is just a fairy guiding me through my quest.

When I need to move, I can glide. When I need to be still, I sit in effortless repose, like a marble statue. My yoga teacher tells us that she practices yoga in the presence of other people, maybe standing in line at the grocery store, and it is her secret. 

Where I am at in the bigger picture of my life makes a big difference. Life must seem possible, and it takes some combination of acceptance and hope. The times when it is hardest to reach flow are the times when I am numb, intentionally or otherwise. 

Flow seems energy efficient, metabolically speaking. My appetite doesn't trouble me and I'm not voracious when I emerge. I am in control, and moments of control beget more moments of control, like a line of fallen dominoes flowing in reverse, each domino gently lifted into place by the last until the last one is standing. 

I have a goal that is simple enough to picture and important enough to hold shape. 

The flow activity can be very different depending on the needs of the moment. Playing music, listening to a friend, writing code, writing a letter or a blog post, playing a game, watching a good movie, dancing, cleaning, exercising. Even just doing nothing but listening to the moment.

At the end of a day of flow, I set up camp in a sheltered place, on a grassy hillside, poking above the forest canopy. I can see how far I came, and I have an idea where I need to go next. 

Flow can be shared, I can find a partner in flow. There's no need to say, "let's flow together," although we could. The place that is just the right size and shape to contain your soul could be just the right size and shape to contain both souls. The the two, held together by steady communication and a shared understanding and purpose.

I feel a steady hope for us, dear sapien, as challenging as the current moment sometimes appears. I believe that each person is capable of flow, but that we don't yet understand how to reach it very easily. It is possible to think of human civilization as a slow march to that place. There is so much we have yet to understand about ourselves. It is difficult to imagine what we might be capable of when we understand more, and there may always be more to understand.

Look at the average life two hundred years ago, or two hundred years before that, and on. Imagine yourself meeting with your ancestors, what would they say? We hold a spirit that guides us to plant trees that we understand are not for us. We have a spirit that lets us start a journey knowing we will not see its end, it is enough to carry the torch.

Every so often, am so moved by a moment in a video game that it becomes crystallized in my memory. Sometimes it is in the middle, like the distant roar of the T-Rex in Tomb Raider. Sometimes it is at the end, like noticing the moon during the boss fight in Portal II. 

In Civilization 6, it is the trailer that plays at the beginning. I'm the kind of player that skips most cinematics, but I am moved every time I watch this one. I will let it speak for itself, it is worth it to watch the whole thing. It is a love letter to the tree planting spirit within us. 

As our collective understanding of the human experience grows, I believe it will reach a point where individuals are empowered and ready to see the way forward will be something like the experience of flow. We will find it in the light of science and art and spirituality.

I named this blog after Eos, the goddess of the dawn. I believe we are at our best when we can look toward the horizon and see light. We do not even need to be certain of a brighter tomorrow to want to plant a seed, all we need is a sense of possibility and hope. It is a hope that is natural to us. We come from a long line of seed planters.
