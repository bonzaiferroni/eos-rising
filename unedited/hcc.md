# Highline Community Church

Back in 2022 my brother and his family were visiting churches and they invited me to join them at HCC. I have the cutest nieces in the world so of course I did. 

The first thing you need to know about HCC is that it is located within the old Denver channel 2 station (aka the WB). The sanctuary used to be the old newsroom set, the control room is now the cry room. Their music director is a local celebrity that was featured on The Voice. It's an easy location if you take the lightrail, just a short stroll from the Arapahoe Station.
